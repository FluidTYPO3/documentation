2.1 Installing using Composer
=============================
 
Installing Fluid Powered TYPO3 with Composer is a simple command-line operation:

Prerequisites: 
- You have to use TYPO3 in Composer-mode. Please look at https://composer.typo3.org/ for more information. 

1. Open a command-line tool and navigate to your project root folder.
2. Execute the command: `composer require fluidtypo3/fluidcontent`.
3. Any dependencies automatically get installed.

Composer resolves all dependencies of extensions that have their dependencies set correctly. For example, installing this site's Provider Extension (`fluidtypo3/fluidtypo3org`) will immediately also install `fluidtypo3/flux`, `fluidtypo3/vhs`, `fluidtypo3/fluidpages` and `fluidtypo3/fluidcontent`.

The composer will warn you if your TYPO3 or PHP version is too low or if an installed extension conflicts with Fluid Powered TYPO3.
