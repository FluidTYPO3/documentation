2.1 Installing using Composer
=============================
 
Installing Fluid Powered TYPO3 with Composer is a simple command-line operation:

Prerequisites: 
- You have to use TYPO3 in Composer-mode. Please look at https://composer.typo3.org/ for more information. 
- It is recommended that you have added `https://composer.typo3.org/` to your list of repositories.

1. Open a command-line tool and navigate to the folder where the composer.json for your TYPO3-installation exists.
2. Execute the command: `composer require typo3-ter/fluidcontent`.
3. Any dependencies automatically get installed.

Composer resolves all dependencies of extensions that have their dependencies set correctly. For example, installing this site's Provider Extension (EXT:fluidtypo3org) will immediately also install `typo3-ter/flux`, `typo3-ter/vhs`, `typo3-ter/fluidpages` and `typo3-ter/fluidcontent`.

The composer will warn you if your TYPO3 or PHP version is too low or if an installed extension conflicts with Fluid Powered TYPO3.
