3.1.1 Generating a Provider extension
=====================================

![FluidTYPO3 File contexts, full](../Images/FileContext/Full.svgz)

This chapter of the documentation describes how to build code automatically. There are a few features in the Fluid Powered TYPO3 family which enable automatic code generation based on conventions. The first and most important such feature is the code generation features of EXT:builder which can be found on Github: [https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/builder](https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/builder).

EXT:builder provides a few methods to validate and build code.

## Generating a Provider Extension

The easiest way to use EXT:builder to create your Provider Extension is to use the included backend module. Simply install EXT:builder, reload the TYPO3 backend and select the new "Builder" menu item. Fill in the author etc. values and press "create", then install your extension.

### Command Line option

For those wanting to automate this or preferring to use CLI, there is also a CLI version of the Provider Extension generator. By running this CLI Command made available by EXT:builder, you can create a skeleton extension with a basic set of files and configuration by using just a single command (from your TYPO3 document root):

```bash
./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase builder:providerextension <arguments>
```

The command supports a wide range of arguments to affect which features the extension should use and how it should be built.

```plain
REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:
  --extension-key      The extension key which should be generated. Must not
                       exist in the typo3conf/ext folder.
  --author             The author of the extension, in the format "Name
                       Lastname <name@example.com>" with optional company name,
                       in which case form is "Name Lastname <name@example.com>,
                       Company Name"

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:
  --title              The title of the resulting extension, by default
                       "Provider extension for $enabledFeaturesList"
  --description        The description of the resulting extension, by default
                       "Provider extension for $enabledFeaturesList"
  --use-vhs            If TRUE, adds the VHS extension as dependency -
                       recommended, on by default
  --pages              If TRUE, generates basic files for implementing Fluid
                       Page templates
  --content            IF TRUE, generates basic files for implementing Fluid
                       Content templates
  --backend            If TRUE, generates basic files for implementing Fluid
                       Backend modules
  --controllers        If TRUE, generates controllers for each enabled feature.
                       Enabling $backend will always generate a controller
                       regardless of this toggle.
  --minimum-version    The minimum required core version for this extension,
                       defaults to latest LTS (currently 4.5)
  --dry                If TRUE, performs a dry run: does not write any files
                       but reports which files would have been written
  --verbose            If FALSE, suppresses a lot of the otherwise output
                       messages (to STDOUT)
  --git                If TRUE, initialises the newly created extension
                       directory as a Git repository and commits all files. You
                       can then "git add remote origin <URL>" and "git push
                       origin master -u" to push the initial state
  --travis             If TRUE, generates a Travis-CI build script which uses
                       Fluid Powered TYPO3 coding standards analysis and code
                       inspections to automate testing on Travis-CI
```

Depending on which toggles you use, template files will be built for EXT:fluidcontent, EXT:fluidpages and/or EXT:fluidbackend, all containing a basic set of configuration enabling the file to be used by each extension. To make a "dry run" specify `--dry 1` which means no files/folders are written but the intent to create each file/folder is output instead. You can even initialise and initially commit all files as a git repository (requires the `git` CLI command to be available to the current shell user).

For example, such a build command might look like:

```bash
./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase builder:providerextension \
	--extension-key test --author "Claus Due <claus@***********.net>" \
	--pages 1 --content 1 --controllers 1 --git 1 --travis 1 --use-vhs 1
```

Which would generate the extension key `test` authored by `Claus Due` with email `claus@***********.net` and include page and content templates as well as controller classes for each, a Travis-CI build script to go along with the extension and finally will create a git repository in the extension folder and initially commit all files.

You can then very easily install the generated extension also from the command line:

```bash
./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase builder:install test
```

Which simply installs the extension key "test" (note: this feature only works on 6.0+ TYPO3 sites). All you then need to do is load the static TypoScript into each root template where you want the content/page templates to be available - and start adding your own templates or adjusting the pre-built placeholder templates.
