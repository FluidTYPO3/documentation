5.1 Online automated tools
==========================

A compiled list of services which you can use - resources for documentation, download locations, code generation services and such.

### Resources

1. [This documentation's repository on Github](https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/documentation). You can submit issues or request for
   changes to this documentation through the official repository.
2. [Official web site](http://fluidtypo3.org/) contains blog/news, references and information about the project and team behind it.
3. [Support chat](http://fluidtypo3.org/community/support-chat.html) is an IRC plugin which lets you speak to us - when we are around.
4. [IRC channel #fedext](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml) which you can access with any IRC client. It's the same channel
   you enter when you use the Support Chat.
5. [Continuous integration using Travis](https://travis-ci.org/FluidTYPO3/flux) displays the current build status for all of our
   extensions. Here, you can investigate the logs in all glorious detail. Simply replace the last url segment with the extension
   key you wish to inspect.
6. [ViewHelper Schema XSD files](https://fedext.net/viewhelpers.html) can be downloaded and used in your editor, for example
   [as explained for PHPstorm on buzz.typo3.org](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/extbase/article/howto-autocompletion-for-fluid-in-phpstorm/),
   to get autocompletion for all ViewHelpers in Fluid itself, and all Fluid Powered TYPO3 extensions.

### Services

There are a few services that you can use to get automatically generated packages for Fluid Powered TYPO3:

#### Provider Extension Generator

You can get a skeleton Provider Extension which uses the most current build function from [EXT:builder](https://github.com/FluidTYPO3/builder)
to generate on-the-fly a Provider Extension with your desired extension key.

To generate a Provider Extension, use this link - but replace `myextension` with the extension key you desire:

```
https://fedext.net/download/providerextension/myextension
```

A skeleton Provider Extension takes about a second to generate and is about 7KB in size. It will always be in `.zip` format which
you can either extract or upload to TYPO3 and install as extension.

#### Bootstrap Package

A complete TYPO3 site based on the "introduction" package from TYPO3 but using Twitter Bootstrap for page and content templates.
This package is built once in a while to contain the latest features for demonstration purposes.

You can download the most recent version at any time using these links:

* http://get.typo3.org/bootstrap (tar.gz)
* http://get.typo3.org/bootstrap/zip (zip)

The package archive is around 55MB in size and contains instructions for its installation.
